# Observing and Modeling Change in Serving Metrics Over Time

# Introduction 
This project was undertaken to observe the change of a variety of serving metrics over the course of a match. Some sought after questions were how does serve efficiency,percentage and errors acccumulate and change over the course of a match? Is there a way we can accurately model and forecast serve percentage in future case using ARIMA modeling? Lastly, how does the efficiency of a serve change based upon the type of serve. 

This project was also undertaken due to the personal experiences with volleyball serving's significance and a desire to dive deeper into some notable metrics to gain greater insight and understanding to a sport that I was very familiar with. 

# Selection Of Data 

My dataset was found via a google search of some datasets and studies related to volleyball. I quite frankly struck gold with a dataset related to a report from a group of students at the University of California Santa Barbara. The dataset includes 9 different matches spanning across NCAA division 1 and professional men's volleyball matches. Below is the information related to our set.
